# MarchMadness
Predicts a March Madness bracket based off the team's seed.

Uses a weighted coin flip. It assigns one team to "heads" and other to "tails." Which ever team reaches their seed number first after 17 "flips" wins that bracket.
Example: Duke (seed 2) vs. Texas Tech (seed 3)
Duke = "Heads" (H)
Texas Tech = "Tails" (T)

Flips:
'H', 'T', 'T', 'T', 'T', 'H', 'T', 'H', 'H', 'T', 'H', 'T', 'T', 'T', 'H', 'T', 'T'

Winner is: Texas Tech

The winner is Texas Tech because in the first 4 flips there are 3 "T's" and only 1 "H's". Therefore, it is predicted that Texas Tech will upset Duke.
